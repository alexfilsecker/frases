Believe you can and you're halfway there.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
It always seems impossible until it's done.
Your limitation—it's only your imagination.
Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.
Great things never come from comfort zones.
Dream it. Wish it. Do it.
Success doesn’t just find you. You have to go out and get it.
The harder you work for something, the greater you’ll feel when you achieve it.
Wake up with determination. Go to bed with satisfaction.
Do not wait for opportunities, create them.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
What you do today can improve all your tomorrows.
Strive for progress, not perfection.
Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
Well done is better than well said.
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
